# Thumper Sample Extractor
Extracts all sample files in Thumper's .pc cache.
Drop these files into the cache folder of your Thumper installation, install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and run `thumper_sample_extractor.py`.

Note that this uses the fsb5 package, which requires you to have libvorbis.dll and libogg.dll in your current directory as well.
